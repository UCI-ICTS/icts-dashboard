This variant has been reported in individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy (PMID: 25163546, 27813223, 29447731, 31112426, 36264615), peripartum cardiomyopathy (PMID: 33874732), atrial fibrillation (PMID: 31691645) and heart failure (PMID: 31691645). This rare variant has been observed in gnomAD with a frequency of <0.001%. This stop gain variant is located in exon 244 of 364, in the I- band with a ""proportion spliced-in"" (PSI) score of 100%. TTN truncating variants encoded in constitutive exons (PSI >90) have been found to be significantly associated with DCM regardless of their position in titin (PMID: 27869827). \"

This variant has not been observed in gnomAD. This variant is predicted to result in a frameshift/premature stop in exon 5 of 5, predicted to escape nonsense mediated decay, leading to the production of stable truncated proteins. Multiple nearby de novo truncating variants have been reported in individuals with SAMD9L related autoinflammatory disorders (PMID: 31874111, 34894360). Inheritance confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

This variant has been described as pathogenic in ClinVar (ID: 15333) and has been reported in a homozygous state in individuals with sickle cell anemia (PMID: 25023084, 19758965, 20301551, 20861612) or in a compound heterozygous state with an HbC allele in individuals with hemoglobin SC disease (PMID: 27982424). Heterozygosity for HbS is consistent with sickle cell trait. This variant has been observed in gnomAD with a frequency of 0.265%. Functional studies in a transgenic mouse model showed this variant sickled following deoxygenation (PMID: 2296310). This missense variant has inconclusive theoretical prediction scores (CADD: 14.400; REVEL: 0.535). The evolutionary conservation of this residue is moderate. Inheritance confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
