For centers that are only uploading single sample files, the aligned_short_read_set_id and aligned_short_read_id values can be identical. For centers uploading multi-sample files, they will need to come up with a value for aligned_short_read_set_id that makes sense to them for indicating the sample group for a multi-sample callset, and use that same value in called_variants_short_read."
