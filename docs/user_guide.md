## Getting an Account & Account Activation
1. Contact the site administrator to have them create an account for you.
2. Once your account is created, you will receive an email that looks like this:

/>

3. Clicking on the button or pasting the link will take you to the password create page. Once you enter and confirm your password you will be redirected tot the log in page.

## Loggin In & Login Page

/>

Above is a diagram of the log in page and the portions that a user can interact with.
1. **Username**: The user name is created by taking the part of the users email address before the `@` symbol. So the user with the email `jdoe@testing.com` will have `jdoe` as their username
2. **Password**: This is where the user enters their passowrd, once a user has activated their account on the create password page.
3. **Remember Me**: This check box will save the user's authentication credentials to the browser. If this box is **NOT** clicked then the user will have to re-authenticate upon a page refresh. Authentication is managed using JSON Web Tokens ([JWT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)).
4. **Log in Button**: Will submit authentication credentials for validation.
5. **Forgot Password**: This will prompt the user to enter their email, and if an account with that email exists they will receive an email prompting them to reset their password (pictured below).
