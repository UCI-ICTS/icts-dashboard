# Database Visualization
Getting a database diagram for visualizing the structure and relationships of the database depending on the setup:

## Local deployment Using Django Tools
Django provides a built-in way to generate a database schema diagram.

Steps:
1. Install the django-extensions package:

        pip install django-extensions

2. Add `django_extensions` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`.

3. Install graphviz for rendering diagrams:

    - For Ubuntu/Debian:

            sudo apt install graphviz

    - For macOS:

            brew install graphviz

    - For Windows: Download from [Graphviz official site](https://graphviz.org/).

4. Run the following command to generate the diagram:

        python manage.py graph_models -a -o db_diagram.png

    - `-a` generates diagrams for all models in the project.
    - `-o` specifies the output file.

### Output:
A db_diagram.png file with a visual representation of your models and their relationships.

## Using Database Tools

### For PostgreSQL:
- pgAdmin:
    - Open your database in pgAdmin.
    - Go to Tools > ERD Tool to generate an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).
- DBeaver (works for multiple databases):
    - Connect to your database in DBeaver.
    - Right-click your database and select ER Diagram.
    - Export the diagram as an image or PDF.

### For MySQL: MySQL Workbench
- Open MySQL Workbench.
- Go to Database > Reverse Engineer.
- This will generate an ER diagram for your schema.
### For SQLite:
- Use tools like [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).
- Alternatively, connect it to a tool like DBeaver.

## Online Tools
If you want a quick solution without installing tools locally, you can use online platforms:

- dbdiagram.io:
    - Allows you to design or import your schema using a simple DSL.
    - Great for collaboration and exporting diagrams.
- QuickDBD:
    - Another online tool where you can define relationships and visualize schemas.

## Recommendations:
- Simple Django Projects: Use django-extensions + graphviz.
- Database Management: Tools like DBeaver or MySQL Workbench are robust and user-friendly.
- Collaboration: Online tools like dbdiagram.io are great for sharing with teams.
